# Haiku Project
## What I Did

- I opened a terminal, and navigated to my chosen directory.

- I used this say command in order to generate an audio [file](/Haiku/Haiku.aiff)

    `say -v "Fred" "Hellol, we have been trying to reach you about your cars extended warranty. Our records indicate you may have a lapse in coverage." -o Haiku.aiff`

## How I Did It

I read the documentation on the class repo and followed that. Then I found a [list](https://gist.github.com/mculp/4b95752e25c456d425c6) of the available voice choices and chose one at random. Thats pretty much it. 

## Problems I Faced
I faced no problems.

## Borrowed Code
I used no code from other sources.
